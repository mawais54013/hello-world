Hi Everyone,
My name is Muhammad, I am recent finance graduate with a passion for coding to be part of my career. I enjoy working with various types of languages, with my favorites being JavaScript and Python to create unique and exciting websites and software. My hobbies include doing landscape photography, playing soccer, drawing, and networking with others in awesome events. I'm looking forward to meeting new people and learning as much about coding to become a software in the near future.
